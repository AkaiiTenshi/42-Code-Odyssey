# 42-Code-Odyssey
My journey through the realms of programming and problem-solving at School 42.

I am currently a student at 42 Paris, and this repo contains my common core projects. I focus on projects that I feel
like I will enjoy doing. You will find my work with some side notes on my thougth process as well as comments on some 
of the projets. I didn't do every bonus part of projects, mostly because I didn't feel like it :sweat_smile:.
